							What are the benefits of setting up an LLC in Texas?
						</h2>
						<div class="post__text text">
							<p>
								An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a fairly new business structure which
								combines the best aspects of two older structures.
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UzTjGMmTj8" target="_blank">Corporations</a>
								have existed since before the US existed, but require heavy maintenance such as
								quarterly meetings with officially recorded minutes, board approval and
								distribution of ownership, and more. On the other side of the spectrum is a sole
								proprietorship (or partnership if more than one person) that possesses tax
								benefits, but doesn't provide the owners with liability protection.
							</p>
							<p>
								Combining the liability protection of a corporation and the tax benefits of a
								partnership, LLCs were created and slowly adopted by all 50 states between
								1977-1998. This means that, as the owner of an LLC, you are not personally liable
								for any debts or obligations of the business. This can be a crucial safeguard for
								a sole proprietor, as transitioning to an LLC protects your personal assets, such
								as your home or savings, in the event that the business is sued or faces financial
								difficulties.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to liability protection, an LLC helps establish credibility for your
								business. When you officially register your business as an LLC, you are signaling
								to the public that you are a professional and legitimate operation. This is
								especially important for a sole owner of a business as customers have more options
								than ever and are more likely to choose a company that feels more trustworthy. Any
								credibility you can build with your future customers is extremely important.
							</p>

						<h2 class="post__title title">1. Choose a Name and Registered Agent in Texas</h2>
						<div class="post__text text">
							<p>
								The first step in setting up an LLC in Texas is choosing a name for your business.
								The name you choose will represent your company and be used on all official
								documents, so it's essential to take the time to carefully consider your options.
							</p>
							<p>
								It may seem tempting to have a very specialized name like "Irene's Texas Ice
								Cream." However, if you're still iterating on your business offering or may
								expand, a somewhat generalized name may work in your favor. Don't fret too much as
								you can always change a Texas LLC's name or use a nickname by filing a Texas DBA.
								More on those post-formation options can be found under
								<b>Step 5: Changes and Maintenance.</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								It's important to choose a name that is unique and not already in use by another
								business. You can use the
								<a href="https://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/" target="_blank">Texas Secretary of State's name check service</a>
								to verify the availability of your desired LLC name. If you are having trouble
								accessing the name check service, you can also call the Texas Secretary of State.
								<b>
									Call 512 463-555 (dial 7-1-1 for relay services) or by sending them your name
									inquiry throug email to</b>
								<a href="mailto:corpinfo@sos.texas.gov">corpinfo@sos.texas.gov..</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								When choosing a name for your LLC, it's important to keep the following guidelines
								in mind:
							</p>

							<ol class="post__list post__list--height">
								<li>
									LLC name should be distinguishable (uniqueness is assessed by TX SOS; for
									example, if similar pronunciation with an existing LLC's name, it will be
									rejected). <br />Example: "Three LLC" will be rejected if there is an existing
									company with the name "3 LLC"
								</li>
								<li>
									LLC name should NOT be the same as an existing domestic or foreign entity,
									registered assumed name (DBA), reserved name.
								</li>
								<li>
									LLC name should NOT indicate or imply that the entity is engaged in a business
									that the entity is not authorized to pursue (e.g., using Corp. or Corporation as
									designator when it should be registered as an LLC).
								</li>
								<li>
									LLC name should NOT falsely imply that the entity is affiliated with a
									governmental entity.
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>
								When choosing a name, it's also important to consider available domain names and
								social handles. One of our early customers owned austineventcollective.com as well
								as austineventcollective across every social platform. Unfortunately, someone in
								Texas already had a registered "Austin Event Collective LLC" and rejected her
								filing.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you’re not ready to file, it is possible to
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUIupJhzOp8" target="_blank">reserve your Texas LLC's name</a>
								before officially registering your LLC with the Texas Secretary of State. Please
								note that this is an additional and separate cost from officially filing your LLC
								and only holds the name, so you have to decide whether reserving a name for a few
								months is a better option than simply setting your Effective Start Date for the
								future (more on this in Step 2).
							</p>

					<div class="post__block">
						<h2 class="post__title title">Choosing a Registered Agent</h2>
						<div class="post__text text">
							<p>
								The next step in setting up an LLC in Texas is choosing a
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7De5BnbQFg&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">registered agent</a>. This person or entity will be responsible for receiving official mail from the
								State of Texas and legal documents on behalf of your business.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Registered Agent must be located in Texas (P.O. Box, PMB, or virtual addresses
								are not allowed). It must be a building or street address. The Registered Agent
								must be available during normal business hours Monday through Friday from 9am to
								5pm to collect mail or service of process in person.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's worth noting that this
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS7Zv6dmSQ8&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">information is considered a public record</a>
								and may be accessed by anyone. This means that anyone can view the names and
								addresses of the
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcZyhQmTlaA&feature=youtu.be">managers or members</a>
								of your LLC by requesting a copy of your Certificate of Formation from the Texas
								Secretary of State. If you are concerned about privacy, you may want to consider
								using a third party to act as a registered agent for your LLC rather than using
								your own personal information. This step helps protect your
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcZyhQmTlaA" target="_blank">operator's and owner's</a>
								privacy and shield your personal information from public view.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are countless options for Registered Agent Service, but we believe
								BetterLegal provides the best value.

							</p>
							<p>Some additional guidelines in Texas for Registered Agents:</p>
							<ol class="post__list">
								<li>
									The organization filing the document may not be designated to serve as its own
									registered agent.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Example: if you want to form a business with the name, ABC LLC, you may not
								designate ABC LLC as its own registered agent. It may be an individual (listed
								managers or members) with a street address in TX, another individual that is not a
								manager or member but is located in TX, or another entity/organization registered
								in TX.
							</p>
							<ol class="post__list">
								<li>
									The person named as the registered agent must have consented, in a written or
									electronic form, to serve as the registered agent for the entity. Failure to
									obtain that consent may result in civil and/or criminal penalties.
								</li>
								<li>
									Titles, such as Mr., Mrs. or Dr., are NOT to be included when typing in an
									individual's name. Neither should professional designations, such as M.D.,
									D.D.S. or Esq., be added to the name.
								</li>
